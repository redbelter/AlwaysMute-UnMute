# AlwaysMute-UnMute utility set

This is a set of utilities that change your audio devices in very simple ways

- AlwaysMute, mutes everything on your system, over and over
- AlwaysUnmute, unmutes everything on your system, over and over
- MuteAllOnce - Mutes everything on your system once
- UnmuteAllOnce - Unmutes everything on your system once

I had issues where some device was muted when it shouldn't have been, or something was unmuted when I thought I muted everything :(

This helps if you have a lot of audio devices on your system but you dont want to manually mute/unmute them all, such as audio over HDMI, bluetooth, etc.
